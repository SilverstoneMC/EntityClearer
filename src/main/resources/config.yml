#            WORLDS / ENTITY TYPES            #
###############################################

# The world(s) to check and remove entities from
# You may add as many worlds to this list as you like
worlds:

  # Example 1
  replace_me_with_world: # <- Replace replace_me_with_world with the desired world name or set it to ALL to apply to all worlds (ALL overrides any other worlds below)

    # Interval in minutes the clear task should run
    # To use the global value above, set the interval to -1
    # To disable the timer, set the interval to 0 (useful if only using TPS monitoring)
    interval: -1
    
    # The amount of players required to be in the WORLD for the clear task to run in said world
    # Set to 0 to run regardless of any players online
    # To use the global-min-players value below and ignore per-world player counts, set the value to -1
    min-players: -1

    # The entities to be removed from the world
    # See https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html for all entity types
    #
    # By default, named entities will not be removed
    # Add "-NAMED" to the end of the entity type to also remove named ones
    #
    # By default, occupied vehicles will not be removed
    # Add "-OCCUPIED" to the end of the entity type to also remove occupied ones
    #
    # The above tags can be used together in any order
    #
    # If using the MythicMobs plugin, you may add the mob type prefixed by "MythicMob:" and surrounded in quotation marks
    #
    # Note: You should not be using ITEM in your list as it's best to let items despawn themselves!

nearby-entities:
  # Should the plugin only remove entities that have multiple entities nearby?
  # This is useful to only remove large groups of entities while leaving smaller entity groups alone
  # Using this would prevent every entity from being removed then just respawning again naturally
  # It is recommended to leave this feature enabled
  enabled: true

  # Should the plugin only count nearby entities that are also on the remove list?
  # Setting this to false will count ANY nearby entity, including players, XP Orbs, Item Frames, etc

  # The distance in blocks that the plugin should check for extra entities
  x: 3
  y: 3
  z: 3
